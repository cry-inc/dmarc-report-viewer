# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest stable release is supported.
This is a small project maintained in my spare time.
I cannot support multiple versions in parallel.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues and vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues.
This is my recommended and preferred way with full transparency.

If you still think its better to report the issue in private,
you can also use the GitHub Security Advisories.

## Bug Bounty

There is no bug bounty and there are no rewards of any kind for reporting bugs and security issues.

## What is covered?

I will do my best to fix all vulnerabilities in my own code and will also update any affected third party dependencies (and there are quite a few) as soon as a fix is available.

However, I cannot guarantee that the maintainers of the external dependencies do the same, since this is not under my control.
